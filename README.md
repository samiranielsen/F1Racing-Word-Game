# Spaceman: F1 Racing Edition
In this fun version of Spaceman, the player must guess the correct letters of the word to get their racer to the finish line. Every wrong guess moves the racing opponent closer to the finish line instead. If the opponent reaches the finish line first, the player loses the game!
> Fun Fact: I chose to build this game because I loved playing Spaceman as a child. I'm also an F1 Racing fanatic, hence the theme!
